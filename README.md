**Examining the market's size is an essential part of market research that figures out the possible sales amount in a specific market. It aids companies in grasping the extent of demand, evaluating how saturated the market is, and spotting chances for expansion.**

**For the task of electric vehicles market analysis, we can explore the following areas:**

1.	### EV Adoption Over Time: Analyze the growth of the EV population by model year.
    Looking at the provided bar chart, it's evident that the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been on the rise, particularly highlighting a noticeable upward slope starting from 2016. Initially, the 
    registration of vehicles increases at a steady pace, but this growth accelerates from 2017 forward. The year 2023 stands out as a year of significant growth in the EV registration numbers, with the 2023 bar 
    being the tallest on the chart, suggesting a maximum point in the adoption of EVs.


2.	### Geographical Distribution: Understand where EVs are most commonly registered (e.g., by county or city).
    Know the areas where electric vehicles are typically registered, such as by county or city. The graph provided shows the comparison of electric vehicle registrations across different cities. The bars in the 
    chart depict cities, and their lengths indicate the number of registered vehicles.


3.	### EV Types: Breakdown of the dataset by electric vehicle type (BEV, etc.).
    The above above pie chart shows that BEVs are more popular or preferred over PHEVs among the electric vehicles registered in the United States.


4. ### 	Maker Popularity: Identify the most popular makes among the registered EVs.
     •  TESLA is in the lead with a significant lead in the number of registered vehicles.

     •  NISSAN comes in second place as a popular manufacturer, with CHEVROLET following closely behind, although both have fewer registrations compared to TESLA.

     •  Following behind are FORD, BMW, KIA, TOYOTA, VOLKSWAGEN, JEEP, and HYUNDAI in descending order of registered vehicles.


5.	### Most registered models:The above graph shows the distribution of electric vehicle registrations among different models.

       •	TESLA’s MODEL Y and MODEL 3 are the most registered vehicles, with MODEL Y having the highest number of registrations.

       •	NISSAN’s LEAF is the third most registered model and the most registered non-TESLA vehicle.

       •	TESLA’s MODEL S and MODEL X also have a significant number of registrations.

       •	CHEVROLET’s BOLT EV and VOLT are the next in the ranking with considerable registrations.


6.	### Electric Range Analysis: Analyse the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.

    The above graph shows the progression of the average electric range of vehicles from around the year 2000 to 2024. Key findings from the graph:
  	
    •	There is a general upward trend in the average electric range of EVs over the years, indicating improvements in technology and battery efficiency.
  	
    •	There is a noticeable peak around the year 2020 when the average range reaches its highest point.
  	
    •	Following 2020, there’s a significant drop in the average range, which could indicate that data for the following years might be incomplete or reflect the introduction of several lower-range models.
  	
    •	After the sharp decline, there is a slight recovery in the average range in the most recent year shown on the graph.
        The data suggest that while there have been fluctuations, the overall trend over the last two decades has been toward increasing the electric range of EVs.

 
8. ### Estimated Growth in Market Size: Analyze and find the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles.
   •	The forecasting shows increase in electric vehicle (EV) registrations for the next five years, expected to be 25% by the end of 2028.
